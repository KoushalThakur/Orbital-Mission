# Solar System Animation

This project demonstrates a simple solar system animation using HTML and CSS. It includes the Sun, Earth, and Moon, with animations depicting the orbits of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth.

## Project Structure

```
solar-system/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── README.md
```



## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the animation.
3. The Sun is fixed at the center of the container, with the Earth orbiting around it. The Moon orbits around the Earth.

## Customization

You can customize the animation speed, size of the celestial bodies, and colors by modifying the `style.css` file:

- Change the `animation-duration` property in the `.Earth` and `.Moon` classes to adjust the orbit speed.
- Modify the `width` and `height` properties of the `.Sun`, `.Earth::before`, and `.Moon::before` classes to adjust the size.
- Adjust the `background-color` properties to change the colors.


Feel free to modify the `README.md` file to fit your project's specific details or any additional information you want to include.
